![GBIPG algorithm overview](/gbipg-overview.png)

Graph-based Ishihara Plate Generation (GBIPG) algorithm can generate a color vision test plate (Ishihara plate) from an image input using a novel graph-based algorithm that is significantly faster than the traditional Monte Carlo method by using a more deterministic approach in creating the plate.

Included in the repository is a terminal application that implements the GBIPG algorithm using the _Processing_ software for performing image processing.
