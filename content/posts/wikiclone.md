A _Wikipedia_ clone that includes features like article CRUD functionality, user role system, and article version control system. Uses a flat table implementation for its database schema for faster reading time, uses _Redis_ for caching recently viewed articles in memory, and uses _Socket.io_ for real-time update on article and user changes.
